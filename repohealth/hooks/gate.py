"""Active Pre-Commit Gatekeeper (SRS 4.4).

Runs on the fast path: staged files only, one indexed baseline lookup each,
and no full-repository graph rebuild unless the cycle check is enabled and the
repository is small enough to afford it. The budget is 1.5s (SRS 5.1.1).

Judgement is made against the STAGED content of each file, obtained via
`git show :path`, not against the working tree -- the developer may have kept
editing after `git add`, and the commit will contain what was staged.
